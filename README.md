# Networks Graph

This repo stores a graph of concepts covered in our Networking class. The graph can be rendered using Foam and VScode. For a detailed setup of the application see https://foambubble.github.io/foam/#getting-started. Once Foam is integrated with VScode clone this repo using,
```console
git clone https://github.com/darkermuppet/Networks-Graph.git
```
Open the newly cloned repo in VScode and use the command dropdown (command + shift + p (MAC)) then click on the command "Foam: Show graph" to render the graph.
